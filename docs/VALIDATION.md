# Validation record — 2026-09-25

**Implemented**, **compiled**, **host-unit-tested**. **Not tested on T-Dongle hardware, macOS USB networking or TeslaAndroid.** No target was flashed; no Pi network configuration changed. This is a development release for physical validation, not an accepted replacement for the working PIX-LINK yet.

Firmware sources built from `e647b51` (subsequent changes are tests, documentation, license retention and packaging). The final generated package manifest records the repository commit and dirty flag. Build environment: Linux x86_64; ESP-IDF v5.5.1 exact commit in SOURCE_AUDIT; Xtensa GCC 14.2.0 `esp-14.2.0_20241119`; Python 3.12.3; host tests GCC 13.3.0. No system package installation or root was needed; local tools were installed in user space.

## Actual build results

All commands exited successfully; final firmware builds had no compiler warnings/errors:

| Command | App size | USB descriptors read from linked ELF |
|---|---:|---|
| `tools/build.sh full` | 1,186,688 bytes | VID:PID `303a:4001`; CDC-ACM control/data + NCM control/data (alternate 0/1); 500 mA |
| `tools/build.sh headless` | 883,920 bytes | Same classes/VID/PID; LCD/LED disabled |
| `tools/build.sh network-only` | 1,178,416 bytes | `303a:4000`; NCM only, no ACM; 500 mA |

Each artifact has a 16 MB ESP32-S3 configuration, PSRAM disabled, NCM enabled, custom 4 MiB app partition and reproducible-build mode. Bootloader and partition images were generated. Checking linked descriptors is **not physical enumeration testing**.

A separate fresh local Git clone, with no build directory or managed components, fetched locked dependencies and ran `tools/build.sh full` successfully. Its **application, bootloader and partition image were byte-identical** to the working-directory full build on the same toolchain. This is a demonstrated two-path clean build, not a claim of universal cross-toolchain reproducibility.

Application SHA256:

```
full          ae8b2f0fb8d0a93f8dd487524a991bf6d42002961167b9a458731e44a885a7dd
headless      e4e1aab58e4555776dd6570d7ba6ec4fbe03a17431306073da3ff9923d5339c1
network-only  976039b8051041a0c4c8711d079b4d569da4f1e8689be8fc8dd9f14a44407cb8
```

Versioned packages are generated in `dist/tdongle-0.1.0-{full,headless,network-only}/` and matching `.tar.gz` files. Internal `SHA256SUMS` covers all package files; adjacent `.sha256` covers each archive. Effective sdkconfig, ELF, source lock, license notices and exact flash offsets are included. No auto-flash step exists. Machine-readable results: [builds.json](results/builds.json).

## Actual host test results

`TEST_CFLAGS='-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer' tools/test.sh`, with GCC 13.3.0 and pinned IDF_PATH: **PASS**. Four C test executables, eight Python unittest cases, and five synthetic layout previews. ASan/UBSan symbols were verified in all four test executables. The script now includes an ASan compiler/runtime probe so unsupported sanitizer flags cannot silently produce a claimed pass.

- Portable core: 100,000 deterministic arbitrary/short frame inputs plus explicit IPv4/ARP/IPv6 boundary cases; reflection filter; address TTL/clock regression; large counter/rate math and counter reset; preferred/priority/exhausted selection; bounded backoff; candidate validation deadline; button bounce, hold one-shot and wake suppression; clipped UI text and truthful Internet label.
- Actual vendored `tinyusb_net.c` body compiled against a deterministic FreeRTOS/USB scheduler: successful copy, cancellation before copy, timeout racing completed copy, backpressure and subsequent recovery. Verifies exactly-once release behavior at the known donor-wrapper failure boundary. It is not a real USB controller stress test.
- Actual `settings.c` against a mock NVS transaction contract: default settings, commit failure preserves old blob, candidate consumption, reboot-during-trial preservation, unknown schema rejection and explicit reset. Real flash power-cut integrity remains pending.
- Shared browser/serial JSON parser with IDF's pinned cJSON source: malformed/non-object input, duplicate/unknown fields, escaped NUL, fractional index, control characters, short passwords and trailing content rejected; valid profile accepted.
- Python: credential bounds/open mode, password entry approach, unavailable tools, permission denial, read-only command inventory, artifact notice recursion prevention and distinct version/variant archive names.
- Five 160×80 bounds previews generated from synthetic states using production text formatting; approximate browser font. No hardware screenshots or invented runtime values.

Raw host results: [host-tests.txt](results/host-tests.txt). Python bytecode compilation, shell syntax checks and Git whitespace checks also passed. `host_diagnostics.py` ran read-only on this development Linux host; mocked unavailable-tool/permission paths passed. That host is **not** the user's Pi or a dongle enumeration target. CI workflow is supplied but has not been run by GitHub in this local-only repository.

Earlier failures were corrected before this record: compiler API integration, a console symbol collision, archive notice recursion, executable bits missing in a fresh checkout, archive suffix collapsing variant names. An initial Zig run accepted ASan flags without emitting ASan; it is **not counted as ASan coverage**. The final sanitizer result above uses native GCC.

## Memory evidence and limits

Link-time size, not runtime free heap:

| Variant | Static DIRAM used | DIRAM remaining in linker budget | Dedicated IRAM used |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| full | 187,515 B | 154,245 B | 16,384 B |
| headless | 144,491 B | 197,269 B | 16,384 B |
| network-only | 184,683 B | 157,077 B | 16,384 B |

Fixed buffers include eight 1514-byte copied frames, three 3200-byte NCM NTBs in each direction, 32 KiB LVGL arena, bounded command/output queues and event/history arrays. Display allocates separate 5120-byte render/DMA buffers. Dynamic Wi-Fi, task stacks, setup netif/HTTP and driver allocations consume additional memory. **Remaining linker RAM is not measured usable runtime heap.** Runtime current/min heap, DMA-capable free memory and UI/control stack watermarks are exposed for the physical test. Throughput, latency, current draw, recovery timing, overnight stability and UI-on/off impact remain unmeasured.

## Pending acceptance / next physical step

[ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md) has the complete unchecked matrix. First: inspect the actual board and ROM-reported flash size, resolve the schematic/product discrepancy, then obtain owner authorization to flash the **headless** build on a Linux test host. Verify power budget, USB enumeration, station association, DHCP/ARP and bidirectional traffic before the full UI build and actual Pi/TeslaAndroid coexistence test.

Hardware release gates include the board's published 800 mA maximum versus USB2's 500 mA descriptor budget, suspend-current compliance, panel offset/color/brightness, all authentication modes, IPv6/multicast, AP/profile failover and power-cut recovery. The installed TeslaAndroid release/fingerprint is unknown; repository NCM support cannot establish it. No real compatibility blocker has yet been observed, so no Android modification, ECM/RNDIS implementation or NAT fallback is proposed.
