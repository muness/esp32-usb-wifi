# Attribution and file-level license review

Project-authored files use MIT. Copyright notices in imported files are retained.

| Files / dependency | License and attribution |
|---|---|
| `main/bridge.c` donor origin | Original header: ©2023–2025 Espressif Systems, Unlicense OR CC0-1.0. Select CC0-1.0 for those portions. DrWhax extensions: MIT, ©2026 白一百 baiyibai; full text `licenses/esp32-usb-wifi-MIT.txt`. Local changes include bounded RX copy pool, ownership fix integration, snapshots, expiry and link state. |
| `main/console.c`, `tools/provision.py` adapted ideas/plumbing | Donor files have no separate conflicting license header; donor MIT retained above. Implementations changed for queued work, no echo, secure password input, new profile protocol and explicit port selection. Original donor tools were inspected rather than shipped with an incompatible protocol. |
| `components/st7735/esp_lcd_st7735.{c,h}` | Copied from the pinned LILYGO `examples/lvgl9/`. Both files inspected: no per-file license notice. Repository MIT applies, ©2022 Xinyuan-LilyGO, retained in `licenses/LILYGO-MIT.txt`. No contradictory nested license in this example. |
| `main/ui.c` display setup | Adapted from `lvgl9.ino`, explicit MIT, Lewis He, ©2025 ShenZhen XinYuan Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. That notice applies to the adapted setup; it is retained here and in the file. No Arduino application imported. |
| `components/esp_tinyusb/**` | Apache-2.0, original per-file SPDX headers and LICENSE retained. Imported package 2.0.1 exact source recorded in SOURCE_AUDIT. Local changes: `tinyusb_net.c` sets completion before releasing its semaphore and returns the finalized result even when deadline races copy; manifest pins TinyUSB; `usb_descriptors.c` declares 500 mA and no remote wakeup. Registry bookkeeping removed from vendored tree. |
| Managed TinyUSB core | MIT, Hathach/TinyUSB contributors; text `licenses/TinyUSB-MIT.txt`. NCM driver source inspected; core commit/package hash pinned. Package includes non-built third-party examples/drivers; they are not silently relabeled MIT. |
| Managed LVGL core | MIT, LVGL contributors; `licenses/lvgl-MIT.txt`. Built-in allocator and printf have their own retained BSD-style/MIT license texts in `LVGL-TLSF.txt`, `LVGL-sprintf.txt`. |
| LVGL `src/font/lv_font_montserrat_10.c` | Generated Montserrat Medium and FontAwesome glyphs, as named in the file header. Montserrat SIL OFL 1.1, copyright Julieta Ulanovsky; FontAwesome's separate font/code/icon terms retained in `licenses/Montserrat-OFL.txt` and `FontAwesome-LICENSE.txt`. No assumption that LVGL MIT replaces font licenses. |
| ESP-IDF | Mainly Apache-2.0, with per-component/per-file exceptions; original NCM example CC0/Unlicense. cJSON MIT; FreeRTOS MIT; LwIP BSD; mbedTLS Apache-2.0 or GPL alternative. Wi-Fi/PHY precompiled libraries have Espressif binary redistribution notices. Build package includes their upstream license files. |
| Host pyserial 3.5 | BSD-3-Clause, Chris Liechti. Tool dependency, not linked into firmware. |
| TeslaAndroid repositories and wireless_nic | Inspected only; no GPL kernel code, Android source, or NAT code linked/copied into firmware. Android tree uses per-file licenses; no blanket license inference is made for its heterogeneous patches/manifests. |

Build tooling copies license/notice files from **linked IDF component directories** (using build metadata), including nested blob licenses, plus managed components, into each successful firmware package. It also records the component/source hash lock. Review package notices before redistributing a binary. Dependency archives may contain optional unlinked libraries with additional licenses; do not infer that enabling those later is covered by this audit.
